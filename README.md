# trackerProgram
A tool to track an object of a certain color with a camera, displaying a square on aimed object.
This program track an object with a particular color with a camera, displaying a square on tracked object.
It was designed to be a tool in order to configure some program which needs to track an specified object with a camera.
Our project is to use it for creating a 'numeric theremin' : theremin's user will put gloves with a certain color and use this program to configure his instrument. 
That's why, in future updates, this program will save user's settings in a file which will be used by theremin's program.

We are Vanessa Dan, Eve Machefert and Alix Plamont, french students working on this school project.
