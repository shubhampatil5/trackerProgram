# trackerProgram
A tool to track any object of a certain color with a camera, displaying a square on aimed object.

It was designed to be a tool to configure some program which needs to track an specified object with a camera.
Our project is to use it for creating a 'numeric theremin' : theremin's user will wear gloves
of a certain color and use this program to configure his instrument. 
That's why, in future updates, this program will save user's setting in a file which will be used
by theremin's program.

The program is achieved with Python 2.7.13, using OpenCV 3.2.0 and PyQt 4.8.7.

We are Vanessa Dan, Eve Machefert and Alix Plamont, french students working on this school project.
