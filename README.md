# trackerProgram
A tool to track any object of a certain color with a camera, displaying a square on aimed object.

It was designed to be a tool to configure some program which needs to track an specified object with a camera.
Our project is to use it for creating a 'numeric theremin' : theremin's user will wear gloves
of a certain color and use this program to configure his instrument. 
That's why, in future updates, this program will save user's setting in a file which will be used
by theremin's program.

We are Vanessa Dan, Eve Machefert and Alix Plamont, french students working on this school project.
